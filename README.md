# Flood-Prediction-Using-Balanced-dataset

Flood Prediction Task was performed modelling Logistic Regression and LSTM algorithms on balanced dataset
Evaluation metrics for each of the algorithms were evaluated.
Default hpyerparameters were used for Logistic Regressesion while LSTM architecture was tuned.
Train_Test_split in 66:34, training set as 66% and Testing set as 34%.
